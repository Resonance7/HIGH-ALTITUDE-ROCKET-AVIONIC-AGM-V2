# HIGH-ALTITUDE-ROCKET-AVIONIC-AGM-V2
Atmel 2560 based 4 layer PCB Features: *pressure sensor *accel. sensor *gps *RF (lora)
*Special power circuits *High amp. pyro channels *Micro sd for logging *Additional servo, uart and I2C pins.

It was born as proof that rocket avionics can be developed with Atmel microcontroller.

It was designed by imagining a system whose hardware was heavily developed but whose software could be easily developed.
